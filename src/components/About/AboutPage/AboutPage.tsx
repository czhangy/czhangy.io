                        Hi there, my name is Charles Zhang! I was born and
                        raised in the LA area of California and recently
                        graduated with a degree in computer science from UCLA. I
                        was practically raised on video games and the countless
                        hours I&apos;ve poured into them are what sparked my
                        interest in CS in the first place, and have played a
                        massive role in shaping who I am today. I&apos;ve been
                        lucky enough to live a fairly drama-free life, so here
                        are fun facts about me to fill enough space for this
                        page layout to work: I played one year of JV tennis in
                        high school, I am the self-proclaimed least competent
                        Eagle Scout in the world, my greatest fear is heights, I
                        don&apos;t know how to ride a bike, I think I&apos;m a
                        very funny person, my girlfriend does not.

                        A lot of my early experience has come from working on
                        full-stack development for small organizations or
                        personal projects. This time has allowed me to help
                        raise awareness for social issues, improve the student
                        experience at UCLA, and give back to online communities.
                        In the summer of 2022, I interned with Capital
                        One&apos;s Auto Refinance team, where I used web
                        development and machine learning to develop and optimize
                        a loan-processing platform. I&apos;ve recently begun
                        work as a SWE at Stripe on the Payments API Features
                        team in Seattle. If for some reason you want more
                        details on my work, check out the projects and

                        Outside of work and school I&apos;m, shockingly, still a
                        massive nerd. As I&apos;ve mentioned, I have a strong
                        passion for video games and have a special place in my
                        heart for the Pok√©mon, Diablo, and Borderlands
                        franchises, but I&apos;ve spent plenty of hours across
                        all sorts of games (most recently Slay the Spire). When
                        it&apos;s basketball season, I also spend hours feeding
                        my obsession for the NBA, and am a huge Warriors fan
                        (not a bandwagon, I swear) and analytics nerd. When I do
                        actually go out and touch grass, I mostly enjoy hanging
                        out with friends and working out on the rare days when
                        I&apos;m not injured.
